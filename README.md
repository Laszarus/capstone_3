# Appleseed 3.0
***
## Introduction
***
My last project ([Appleseed 2.0](https://github.com/Laszarus/capstone_2)) concluded with a CNN that erroneously classified all 
image tiles as water. In this iteration of Appleseed, my goal was to **remedy this misclassification issue** and **optimize 
the CNN for practical application**. I reached this goal by performing the following steps:

1. Relabeling and balancing classes
2. Restructuring neural network architecture
3. Retraining model
4. Creating output visualization application
